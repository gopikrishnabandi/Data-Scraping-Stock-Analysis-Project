# Data-Scraping-Stock-Analysis-Project
The idea of the project is to scrape NASDAQ website using selenium and analyze the stocks using python data libraries namely numpy and pandas
Datascrapper.py scrapes through the pages and stores the data into a csv file.
MiniScrapper.py uses the download data option present in the website.
